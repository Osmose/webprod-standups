# Webprod Standup

A simple app that lets you view the latest standups from everyone in the
Mozilla Websites Team.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. `cp config.js-dist config.js`
3. Add config info to `config.js`

## Usage Notes

- This app uses Yammer's JS API. When a user first uses the app there may be
  issues with blocked popups or login not working perfectly. These should go
  away with a refresh and some hope.
